Do not add anything extra or unncessary or unrequired or anything I haven't instruced you to do not add.
Do not suggest anything, just think upon what I provide to you.

Project Root folder is : Relative Path: './' 
Actual Path: '/Users/jayoswal/Documents/DrapeAI/Frontend-Waitlist/drapeai-waitlist-launch/'

Ignore and do not read and understad 'human-prompt.txt' file.

Create Well Documented, Readable, Maintainable, Modular code.

We will go step by step. We will start from scratch
Give me every instructions clearly, any commmands to run in terminal etc
Ask for more information if u require, do not assume anything, always confirm with me once before implementing.
We will do one step at a time, debug until success and then move to next step and so on.
