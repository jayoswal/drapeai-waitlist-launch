- single page.
- all content should be within viewport, no scrollabe (vertical or horizontal) page.
- make UI tactile and feel like grounded
- Responsive and fast UI (mobile first optimized)
- Scrollable Image slider will be our hero product and we will be spending majority time working on it.
- The scroll should be super smooth and fast. When user tries to scroll the page, the slider should be scrolled and also user can drag the slider.
This should also work when user does the scroll wheel on the mouse.
- We will use HTML, CSS & JS
- The required images will be kept in a directory, let me know which and where directory to put it in. The code can iterate over the files in it, No need to hardcode the files name
- We will start and implement one section at a time
- Git is already initialized here.
- Slider Reference Code avaiable in this file: '.github/prompts/reference-slider-code.prompt.md'
