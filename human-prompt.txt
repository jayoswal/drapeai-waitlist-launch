ALso check if # uses anything to make the slider smooth or anything extra and we are not doing that please do it exactly like the reference code


the height of the images should be same throughtout, with images fit (no etra bars at top or bottom) and the aspect ratio as original image



at around 500px when the viewport increases, the height also increases drastically huge, keep the max height a bit reduced



Now above the slider we will add out logo  svg - placed at 'DRAPEAI-LOGO-SVG.svg'
and the logo text 'DrapeAI' font At Aero Medium placed at 'AtAero-Medium.otf' and font color: '#868686'
this should be logo SVG <-4px space between-> logo text
and the size of the svg should be equal to the height of the letter D in the Logo text
Place both at top 10% and we will adjust from there
size start with something and it will be dynamic according to viewport.


can u reduce the just the svg size a bit (just svg indivually, the starting size)
tell me what was before and what u changed it to?


SVG position according to viewport we want this,
approx before around 540 something: the logo should be litle up
then approx around 640 something: the logo should be little down
slightly

also tell me whats the latest adjustment did for this.



Now below the slider we add tagline of the DrapeAI which is 'Studio Grade High Fashion Photoshoot Generated in Just Minutes'
This will be ceneterd & responsive as well with words wrapping onto next line 
font color: #43423e
font: strictly use - Plus+Jakarta+Sans
Place at someplace and set a size to begin with, we will adjust it.
