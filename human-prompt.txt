ALso check if # uses anything to make the slider smooth or anything extra and we are not doing that please do it exactly like the reference code


the height of the images should be same throughtout, with images fit (no etra bars at top or bottom) and the aspect ratio as original image



at around 500px when the viewport increases, the height also increases drastically huge, keep the max height a bit reduced



Now above the slider we will add out logo  svg - placed at 'DRAPEAI-LOGO-SVG.svg'
and the logo text 'DrapeAI' font At Aero Medium placed at 'AtAero-Medium.otf' and font color: '#868686'
this should be logo SVG <-4px space between-> logo text
and the size of the svg should be equal to the height of the letter D in the Logo text
Place both at top 10% and we will adjust from there
size start with something and it will be dynamic according to viewport.


can u reduce the just the svg size a bit (just svg indivually, the starting size)
tell me what was before and what u changed it to?


SVG position according to viewport we want this,
approx before around 540 something: the logo should be litle up
then approx around 640 something: the logo should be little down
slightly

also tell me whats the latest adjustment did for this.



Now below the slider we add tagline of the DrapeAI which is 'Studio Grade High Fashion Photoshoot Generated in Just Minutes'
This will be ceneterd & responsive as well with words wrapping onto next line 
font color: #43423e
font: strictly use - Plus+Jakarta+Sans
Place at someplace and set a size to begin with, we will adjust it.


The number 54 (from the button will be repplaced to fetch the number from datasource, right now leave it hardocded 54)
Now on clicking the button, a popup model should appear on the screen centered horizontal and vertical, the modal should be responsive as well.
All text inside the modal should be Plus+Jakarta+Sans
The purpose of the modal is to collect email & mobile number of users,
there will be
1. Heading: Early Access , color: #43423e
2. Sub heading: Studio-grade high fashion visuals, generated in just minutes. color: '#868686'
3. Enter email field (email field)
4. Enter mobile number field, the field has country flag selection drop down with default as India, users just have to enter mobile number in the field (numeric field)
5. Submit button with label: 'Join the Waitlist '
The submit button should validate email and number for mobile number
6. Upon successful sending, a message Thank You! we will reach out to you soon.
For now mimic successful sending, later on we will integrate sending the data to dataources

Add margin and padding to the card, right now its sticking to the edges (especiall mobile view)
left-align the heading and the subheading.
add all the countries in the drop down along with their contry code.

and the success message should be just the success message (remove the heading and sub heading from there)
it should be heading and color #43423e , left aligned as well.
And after success the modal should auto close after 10 seconds (also show a cross out button top right at this stage only)


reduce the size of the placeholder texts, and add padding inside the modal

the sucess modal should have a height and the text align center and left


Now at the footer, I want to add 'Contact Us' hyperlink with dotted underline, color: #868686, and font: Plus+Jakarta+Sans
on clicking it should open a modal with cross out button.
Content of the modal will be an email and phone/WhatsApp number only.
The 'Contact Us' should be small and look solid and at sticky footer, font size should be preferrably small but should increase proportionaly according to view port.
Implement and I will tell u if any changes needed.

add little shadow (very little) to the button
