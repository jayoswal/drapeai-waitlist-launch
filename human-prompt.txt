ALso check if # uses anything to make the slider smooth or anything extra and we are not doing that please do it exactly like the reference code


the height of the images should be same throughtout, with images fit (no etra bars at top or bottom) and the aspect ratio as original image



at around 500px when the viewport increases, the height also increases drastically huge, keep the max height a bit reduced



Now above the slider we will add out logo  svg - placed at 'DRAPEAI-LOGO-SVG.svg'
and the logo text 'DrapeAI' font At Aero Medium placed at 'AtAero-Medium.otf' and font color: '#868686'
this should be logo SVG <-4px space between-> logo text
and the size of the svg should be equal to the height of the letter D in the Logo text
Place both at top 10% and we will adjust from there
size start with something and it will be dynamic according to viewport.


can u reduce the just the svg size a bit (just svg indivually, the starting size)
tell me what was before and what u changed it to?


SVG position according to viewport we want this,
approx before around 540 something: the logo should be litle up
then approx around 640 something: the logo should be little down
slightly

also tell me whats the latest adjustment did for this.



Now below the slider we add tagline of the DrapeAI which is 'Studio Grade High Fashion Photoshoot Generated in Just Minutes'
This will be ceneterd & responsive as well with words wrapping onto next line 
font color: #43423e
font: strictly use - Plus+Jakarta+Sans
Place at someplace and set a size to begin with, we will adjust it.


The number 54 (from the button will be repplaced to fetch the number from datasource, right now leave it hardocded 54)
Now on clicking the button, a popup model should appear on the screen centered horizontal and vertical, the modal should be responsive as well.
All text inside the modal should be Plus+Jakarta+Sans
The purpose of the modal is to collect email & mobile number of users,
there will be
1. Heading: Early Access , color: #43423e
2. Sub heading: Studio-grade high fashion visuals, generated in just minutes. color: '#868686'
3. Enter email field (email field)
4. Enter mobile number field, the field has country flag selection drop down with default as India, users just have to enter mobile number in the field (numeric field)
5. Submit button with label: 'Join the Waitlist '
The submit button should validate email and number for mobile number
6. Upon successful sending, a message Thank You! we will reach out to you soon.
For now mimic successful sending, later on we will integrate sending the data to dataources

Add margin and padding to the card, right now its sticking to the edges (especiall mobile view)
left-align the heading and the subheading.
add all the countries in the drop down along with their contry code.

and the success message should be just the success message (remove the heading and sub heading from there)
it should be heading and color #43423e , left aligned as well.
And after success the modal should auto close after 10 seconds (also show a cross out button top right at this stage only)


reduce the size of the placeholder texts, and add padding inside the modal

the sucess modal should have a height and the text align center and left


Now at the footer, I want to add 'Contact Us' hyperlink with dotted underline, color: #868686, and font: Plus+Jakarta+Sans
on clicking it should open a modal with cross out button.
Content of the modal will be an email and phone/WhatsApp number only.
The 'Contact Us' should be small and look solid and at sticky footer, font size should be preferrably small but should increase proportionaly according to view port.
Implement and I will tell u if any changes needed.

add little shadow (very little) to the button

UTM: from URL
source
medium
referrer
along with
visit_id:

email,number,user-agent,ip,geo-location: from: the card, along with visit_id

current_waitlist number field

also 

Now suggest me some databse to choose from (high speed, lightweight) and how we will architect this.



-- SQLite
SELECT * FROM waitlist_number;

SELECT * FROM visit_details;

SELECT * FROM submission_details;

DELETE FROM waitlist_number;
DELETE FROM visit_details;
DELETE FROM submission_details;

Now I have a s3 bucket 'drapeai-wailist-launch-db' I want to copy the wailist.db (I am at the file apth itself) file there how do I do that through ec2 connected ssh?

No need to reply, just understnad the placement of the items, we have four main items
1. Logo svg + Logo text
2. SCROLL TO VIEW MORE" hint text
3. Image carosul (image slider)
4. Tag Line
5. Click to Join button.
6. Contact Us

Understand how th placement (from top/bottom is presently) its inefficient and not working across different viewport,
we want mobile first responsiveness
The sizing is so far correct and needs no changes but the placement is something we need to look at.

So understand that, we do not want to hardcode for several viewport, it should be responsice in true sense.



The correct order if items are (starting from top)
Logo Bar
Image Carousel
Tagline
Join Button

Understand how th placement (from top/bottom is presently) its inefficient and not working across different viewport,
we want mobile first responsiveness
The sizing is so far correct and needs no changes but the placement is something we need to look at.
The viewport should not be scrollable at all.
We just have to tweak the placement of the elements
So understand that, we do not want to hardcode for several viewport, it should be responsice in true sense.

DONE---------
Now lets work on placing the elemets one by one.
Lets start with the Logo svg + Logo text (what is the current position)?
we are only working with placement (vertically) of the elements

Now the scroll for more helper text displays and after it disappears the image carousal moves up,
I want the fixed position of image carousel irrespective the helper text,
so tell me the current position of
helper text
image carouseal

DONE------------------


Now instead of the hardocded px values for 6 elements placement (from top) and sizes
I want to use the percentage system,
start by mentioning all the current placement config (clamp as well if using it) and use some approximate percentage for placement only (from top) for all 6 elementsthen I can help in tweaking it as requried.


Reason for this is for some viewport, the button and the footer Contact Us are overlapping

DONE-----------------
If user is on mobile device:
I want the scroll infro text from: SCROLL TO VIEW MORE to 'DRAG TO VIEW MORE'
and if user is on dektop/pc device
I want the scroll infro text from: SCROLL TO VIEW MORE to 'HOVER / DRAG TO VIEW MORE'
